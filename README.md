# Algorithms, Part II

This is where all my work lives for the Coursera course [Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2), by Princeton University. I created it as a Maven project based on a [demo Maven project](https://github.com/fbricon/algs4j-demo) by fbricon.

Please note this is not a complete Maven project. The course prohibits the use of packages. Plus, I'm not all that familiar with building Maven projects, nor the Maven conventions. I honestly just wanted to use VS Code's intellisense for the class's library. You got me.
